## Types of Custom Models

Kive supports training two types of custom models to help you generate exactly what you need:

### Style Models

Style models are perfect for maintaining consistent aesthetics across your generated images. They excel at learning:

- Brand guidelines and visual identity
- Campaign-specific styles 
- Artistic directions
- Visual tone and mood

### Object Models

Object models are trained to understand specific items and products:

- Fashion items (clothing, accessories, etc.)
- Product packaging and containers
- Branded merchandise
- Physical products of any kind

## Training Your Model

<Steps>
  <Step title="1. Prepare Your Training Data" icon="image">

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="2. Upload Your Images" icon="cloud-arrow-up">
    Upload your prepared images to Kive:
    - Ensure images are under 5MB each
    - Use consistent aspect ratios when possible
    - Remove any irrelevant or low-quality images
  </Step>

  <Step title="3. Configure Training Settings" icon="gear">
    Select your training preferences:
    - Choose between object or style model
    - Set your model name and description
    - Adjust any advanced settings if needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="4. Start Training" icon="play">
    Begin the training process:
    - Monitor the training progress
    - Training typically takes 15-30 minutes
    - You'll receive a notification when complete
  </Step>

  <Step title="5. Test Your Model" icon="flask">
    Validate your model's performance:
    - Generate test images
    - Verify accuracy and quality
    - Make adjustments if needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Training Requirements

### For Object Models

To train an effective object model, you'll need:

- Approximately 10 high-quality images of your object
- Images should be well-lit, preferably with natural lighting
- Photos can be taken with a smartphone (iPhone quality is sufficient)
- Higher resolution images will produce better results
- Multiple angles of the object are recommended

<Tip>
When capturing photos for training, ensure:
- Good lighting conditions (natural light works best)
- Clear, uncluttered backgrounds
- Multiple angles of the object
- Consistent image quality across your training set
</Tip>

### For Style Models

Style models learn from examples that demonstrate your desired aesthetic:

- Brand guidelines and visual assets
- Campaign photography
- Consistent artistic direction
- Color palettes and visual elements

## Best Practices

1. **Image Quality**: Always use the highest quality images available for training
2. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent lighting and photography conditions
3. **Variety**: Include different angles and contexts for object models
4. **Clear Examples**: Use clear, representative examples of your desired style or object
5. **Testing**: Start with a small batch of generations to verify model performance

<Note>
The quality of your training images directly impacts the quality of your generated results. Taking time to prepare good training data will lead to better outcomes.
