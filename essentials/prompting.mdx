## Basic Prompting

### Simple Prompts

The most basic way to generate images is with a simple descriptive prompt. Be specific about what you want to see.

```prompt Basic
A serene lake at sunset with mountains in the background, peaceful atmosphere
```

### Detailed Prompts

For better results, include specific details about style, lighting, and composition.

```prompt Detailed
A serene mountain lake at golden hour, dramatic sunset colors reflecting on calm water, snow-capped peaks in background, photorealistic style, soft lighting, high resolution landscape photography
```

## Advanced Techniques

### Style Specification

Define the artistic style you want by referencing specific mediums or techniques.

```prompt Style
Oil painting of a bustling medieval marketplace, impasto technique, rich textures, vibrant colors, Dutch Masters style
```

### Prompt Structure

A well-structured prompt typically contains these key elements:

The `subject` is your main focus - what you want to see in the image.

The `environment` describes the setting and background details.

Use `lighting` to specify the mood and atmosphere through light conditions.

Define `style` to set the artistic approach - like `photorealistic`, `oil painting`, or `digital art`.

Add `technical` details like `8K`, `ultra-wide`, or `macro shot` for specific quality requirements.

For example:

```prompt Structure
Young astronaut in detailed spacesuit, 
floating in space with Earth visible below, 
dramatic rim lighting from distant sun, 
hyperrealistic digital art, 
8K resolution, 
ultra-wide composition
```

## Best Practices

### Quality Enhancers

Add these terms to enhance specific aspects:

For quality: `highly detailed`, `masterpiece`, `professional`, `8K`
For lighting: `volumetric lighting`, `dramatic shadows`, `golden hour`
For style: `hyperrealistic`, `concept art`, `cinematic`, `photorealistic`
For composition: `ultra-wide`, `macro`, `aerial view`, `portrait`

### Common Mistakes

Avoid these common pitfalls:
- Using `bad`, `wrong`, or `don't` - focus on what you want instead
- Mixing too many `<style>` elements - stick to one cohesive style
- Being too `vague` - be specific about what you want
- Using copyrighted character names

## Advanced Examples

### Environment Design

```prompt Environment
Futuristic cyberpunk city street at night, neon signs reflecting in puddles, holographic advertisements floating in air, dense urban architecture, volumetric fog, cinematic lighting, ultra-wide angle, highly detailed 8K rendering
```

### Character Design

```prompt Character
Portrait of a wise elderly alchemist in their workshop, intricate steampunk goggles, weathered face with detailed wrinkles, surrounded by glowing potions and brass instruments, rembrandt lighting, oil painting style, extreme detail
```

### Abstract Concepts

```prompt Abstract
Visualization of consciousness emerging from digital networks, flowing energy patterns, neural pathway aesthetics, deep blues and purples, abstract digital art style, particle effects, high contrast, ethereal atmosphere
```
